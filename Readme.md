Module 1: Basics of OpenCV
Installation and Setup (1 day)

Install OpenCV on Ubuntu: pip install opencv-python.
Understand the basic libraries (cv2, NumPy).
Working with Images (3-4 days)

Read, display, and write images (cv2.imread, cv2.imshow, cv2.imwrite).
Image properties: resolution, channels, color space (BGR vs. RGB).
Resize, crop, and rotate images.



Basic Image Operations (4-5 days)

Drawing shapes (lines, rectangles, circles) and text on images.
Image arithmetic (addition, blending, bitwise operations).
Image transformations: affine, perspective.
Daily Practice: 1-2 hours of coding and experimenting with image transformations and basic operations.
